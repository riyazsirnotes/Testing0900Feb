Manual Testing 

Software : set of instructions or programs to accomplish some task

e.g : calculator , whatsapp etc ..

Types of Softwares:

1 . System Software :

e.g - Operating System , drivers etc..

2. Programming Software : 

e.g : compiler , interpreters , debugging tools etc ..


3. Applictaion Softwares:

e.g : Web Applictaions , mobile apps , mainframe apps , silverlite apps , SAP apps


Testing:

It's a process of checking developed software is working as per client business requirments
or not

-> to find defects or bugs

- > primary motto of testing is to deliver a quality and a risk free product



what to test in now-a-days applications (web or mobile ) ?

- Funcationalities 
- GUI(graphical user interafce)
- Load Testing
- Performance Testing
- Security Testing
- Usability 

how to test ?

1. Manual Testing

Testing activity carried out for testing software applications using Man effort 
Then it is called Manual Testing

2.Automation Testing :

Testing activity carried out for testing software applications using 
some tools or programs .

Then it is called Automation Testing


Automation :

The process of converting Test Cases into Test Script using some tools


Terminilogies in Software development or testing :

Product : 

if a software application developed for multiple users 



Project : 

if a software application developed for a speicific or single user or organization

 Terminilogies in Software development or testing  (Cont ...)
 
 
 - Error 
 
 Any incorrect human action or mistakes which gives wrong results
 
 - Defect / Bug / Fault / Issue :
 
 Deviation between expected Behaviout to Actual Behaviour of the system is called Defect.
 
 
 - Failure / Incident :
 
 If an end user identifies a defect while using software application
 Then it is called Failure.
 
 
 Note : 
 
 presence of errors results in Defects and Presence of defects will results in Failure
 
 
 
 why do a software application have defects ?
 
 
 1) Incorrect requirments
 2) Wrong Design
 3) Wrong Coding 
 4) poor Coding
 5) complex architecture
 6) work pressure or time pressure
 7) frequently changing business requirments

Validation :It is process of checking developed  software is working as per client requirement or not


It is also called as Dynamic Testing
