Manual Testing 

Software : set of instructions or programs to accomplish some task

e.g : calculator , whatsapp etc ..

Types of Softwares:

1 . System Software :

e.g - Operating System , drivers etc..

2. Programming Software : 

e.g : compiler , interpreters , debugging tools etc ..


3. Applictaion Softwares:

e.g : Web Applictaions , mobile apps , mainframe apps , silverlite apps , SAP apps


Testing:

It's a process of checking developed software is working as per client business requirments
or not

-> to find defects or bugs

- > primary motto of testing is to deliver a quality and a risk free product



what to test in now-a-days applications (web or mobile ) ?

- Funcationalities 
- GUI(graphical user interafce)
- Load Testing
- Performance Testing
- Security Testing
- Usability 

how to test ?

1. Manual Testing

Testing activity carried out for testing software applications using Man effort 
Then it is called Manual Testing

2.Automation Testing :

Testing activity carried out for testing software applications using 
some tools or programs .

Then it is called Automation Testing


Automation :

The process of converting Test Cases into Test Script using some tools


Terminilogies in Software development or testing :

Product : 

if a software application developed for multiple users 



Project : 

if a software application developed for a speicific or single user or organization

 Terminilogies in Software development or testing  (Cont ...)
 
 
 - Error 
 
 Any incorrect human action or mistakes which gives wrong results
 
 - Defect / Bug / Fault / Issue :
 
 Deviation between expected Behaviout to Actual Behaviour of the system is called Defect.
 
 
 - Failure / Incident :
 
 If an end user identifies a defect while using software application
 Then it is called Failure.
 
 
 Note : 
 
 presence of errors results in Defects and Presence of defects will results in Failure
 
 
 
 why do a software application have defects ?
 
 
 1) Incorrect requirments
 2) Wrong Design
 3) Wrong Coding 
 4) poor Coding
 5) complex architecture
 6) work pressure or time pressure
 7) frequently changing business requirments

Now-a-days TEsting :

It's a process of checking are we developing  right software and also checking developed software
working as per client business requirements or not


Software Testing = Verifaction + Validation 

Verifictaion : It is process of checking are we developing right software or not

It is also called as Static Testing

Validation :It is process of checking developed  software is working as per client requirement or not


It is also called as Dynamic Testing


-------------------------------------------------------

what are roles and duties of tester ?

1)Understanding application under Test (AUT)

2)Formal Testing ( writing and executing test cases)

3)Adhoc Testing or Informal (NO TEst Cases)

4) Finding defects and report to developers

5) Retesting and Regression Testing

6) Developing automation test scripts

7) executing automation test scripts

8) Analyse Test Reports

9) Prepare Test Report

Software Testing Principles :

1. Exhaustive Testing is impossible

If we test a functionality with all possible valid inputs and Invalid inputs 
then it is called exhaustive testing.

In simple words , testing everything is called exhaustive testing.

If we check login with all registered users then it is called exhaustive testing.
which is practically impossible.

Instead of validating all user , we choose few from each category and then validate.

2. Defect Clustering :

sometimes a small functionality may produce more number of defects when compared to bigger functionality

for e.g , Registration functionality might have many field in it's page 
compare to payment gateway page .

but there will be complex business logic runs behind payement gateway page.

so here we need to put more effort on Payment gateway page compared to registration page.


3. Pesticide Paradox 

If prepared test cases are not able to find defects.
Then add more test cases or modify test cases if required for better testing 


4. Early Testing

Conducting testing as soon as possible in the development life cycle .


Testing right from requirements phase is called Early Testing.

5. Testing is application dependent / situation dependent :

TEst approach may slightly vary from project to project.

for e.g : Testing a calculator application is different from testing shopping application

As calculator application is a desktop application , there is no need of Load or Performance testing


Testing is situation dependent.

sometimes test approach may slightly change based on time availabilty , resource availabilty and cost.

i.e if sufficient time availabilty you will go for both Formal and Informal testing
otherwise only Formal Testing


6. Testing should show presence of defects 

Always testing should be carried out with an intention of finding defects .

We have to find defects before customer find them.

This can be achived by doing negative testing .


7. Absence of defects is a fallacy

Software Developement Life Cycle (SDLC) :



SDLC Models :


A SDLC model will explain how various development activities implemented in a project.

SDLC Models are classified in two types

									SDLC
									
			Sequential Models						Incremental Models
			
			1. Waterfall Model						1. RAD (Rapid Application Developement)
			2. V-Model							    2. Protype Model
													3. Spiral Model
													4. Agile Model

1. Waterfall Model	

Waterfall model is well suited for developing small size projects where requirements are very clear

2. V-Model

V-Model model is well suited for developing small size projects 
where requirements are not clear




1. RAD Model :

RAD  model is suitable for big projects which to be completed in short span of time.

2. Prototype Model :

Protoype model is best suited for developing big size projects , we opt thisfor the following two
scenarios.

i. if customer providing a reference application
ii. If customer requirements are not clear


3. Spiral Model

SoftWare Testing = Verification + Validation

Static Testing :

It's a process of chekcing are we developing right software or not
It's carried out in organization through reviews

Review :

Examing a project related task is a review.

Requirement Reviews :

Reviews carried out by domain experts to find mistakes at requirment phase 
 
Design Reviews : 

Reviews carried out by system  experts to find mistakes in Design

Code Reviews :

These reviews are carried out by senior developers to find any deviations in coding standards

Test Cases Reviews :

These review are carried out by senior testers preferably Test leads to check the test cases are
enough to test the project.


Formal Reviews :

If any review activity carried out by following proper review procedures or guidelines .


Inspection and Audit are the best examples for Formal Reviews.

Inspection : if a formal review carried out while executing a task

Audit : if a formal review carried out after execution of task

Peer reviews : reviews done within peers

Walk Through's:

Knowledge Transfer sesions conducted 

-----------------------------------------------------
Dynamic Testing 


White Box Testing :

Testing conducted on the source code by developers to make sure developed code is working as expected


Unit Testing :

A smallest part in source code of application such as programs, functions etc  are called units

Testing conducted on this units is called Unit Testing


Integration Testing :

once all units are tested ,  programs are combined together.

Testing conducted on overall output is called Integration Testing.

Black BOx Testing :

Once Integration testing is done , the source is coverted to executable format 
called Build or exe file and deployed into system.

Testing conducted on System or developed applictaion is called Black box testing.


--------------------------------------------------

Functional System Testing Types :

1) Smoke Testing :

It is a kind of quick test or rough test performed on given application or build to decide
whether it is eligible for further detailed testing or not


what to be verified in smoke Testing ?

- we have to check all major functionalities are available ?
- we have to check the given application is consistently operable or not 


Objective of smoke testing is to make sure whether given application is testable or not
- not to find defects
